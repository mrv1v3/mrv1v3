### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Marvin
#### I am a Self taught devoloper
I started learning programming when i was 15. In the beginning I taught my self how to programm and use a **arduino**. This lead to me also getting into programming desktop applications. I informed myself about the different programming languages. I deceided to look into **C#** and coded my first Discord bot and tried a few other simply projects. After I experimented a bit with C# I switched to **Python**. I have using it since then as my main coding language. I focus on programming Discord bots for all needs.
All this caused me an apprenticeship as an [ electronics technician for automation technology ](https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektroniker_f%C3%BCr_Automatisierungstechnik) at an big company

Skills: Python

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Discord Bot using nextcord
